```
###### Architecture Components
- **Frontend**: The interface for the player, where they can see the game and interact with it by clicking, selecting choices and typing text.

- **Backend**: The server-side system that processes the player's input and generates new content, communicates with the frontend and stores data about the game state.

###### Frontend 
The frontend will run on the player's device and will be responsible for the following:
- Displaying the game interface, including graphics, sound, text, and UI controls.
- Recording user input, such as mouse clicks, keyboard input, or touchscreen interactions.
- Storing user preferences, such as language, sound settings, and input mappings.
- Communicating with the backend to retrieve game content, save game progress, or request additional features.

###### Backend
The backend will run on a cloud infrastructure and provide the following functionalities:
- Generating game content based on user input and game data.
- Storing and retrieving game data, such as characters, locations, items, and events.
- Managing game progress, by saving and restoring game states, tracking achievements, and handling user accounts.
- Providing a public API for the frontend, as well as an admin interface for game developers to manage content and settings. 

###### Cloud Architecture
To implement this adventure game architecture, we suggest using the following cloud services:
- **Frontend**: A static website hosting service, such as AWS S3, to store and serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files of the game interface. The frontend can communicate with the backend via REST APIs hosted on a separate server or via WebSocket connections.
- **Backend**: A serverless compute service, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, to run the game logic and data processing. The backend can use a database service, such as AWS DynamoDB or Firebase, to store and retrieve game data, and a caching service, such as AWS ElastiCache or Redis, to optimize performance. The backend should also leverage a content delivery network (CDN), such as AWS CloudFront, to cache frequently accessed game assets, and a load balancer, such as AWS Application Load Balancer, to route traffic to different backend instances. The backend can also use serverless event-driven services, such as AWS EventBridge or Azure Event Grid, to trigger workflows based on game events, such as player actions, game state changes, and time-based actions.

Overall, this cloud technical architecture provides a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution to run an adventure game in the style of Maniac Mansion, allowing developers to focus on creating compelling content and engaging gameplay, while providing players with a seamless and immersive experience across different devices and platforms.

## SECTION 5: DATA SOURCES

To create an adventure game in the style of Maniac Mansion, a number of data sources are required. These include:

#### 1. Game engine

First and foremost, a game engine is required. A game engine provides the framework for creating the game, including handling graphics, sound, user input, and game logic. There are many game engines to choose from, but some popular ones for adventure games include Adventure Game Studio and Unity.

#### 2. Art assets

A large number of art assets are required for an adventure game, including backgrounds, characters, and items. These assets should be created in a consistent style, and should be designed to work together to create a coherent world.

#### 3. Game script

The game script outlines the story of the game and the various puzzles that the player will need to solve. This should be written in a clear and concise manner, and should include dialogue for the game's characters.

#### 4. Sound effects and music

Sound effects and music are important in creating an immersive game world. A variety of sound effects are required, including footsteps, doors opening and closing, and other environmental effects. Music should be created to fit the tone of the game.

#### 5. Programming code

Programming code is required to bring the game to life. This includes code for handling user input, game logic, and user interface elements. The code should be well-organized and easy to maintain.

#### 6. Testing and feedback

Finally, testing and feedback are essential to creating a successful game. Regular playtesting should be conducted to identify and fix bugs, and to ensure that the game is challenging and engaging. Feedback from playtesters and other stakeholders should be incorporated into the game to improve its quality.
